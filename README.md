# PasswordGenerator

I created a little program using a GUI to generate a password containing specific characters.
I created this because I have to create multiple users per week and I want the password to contain specific characters.
In the GUI, click Generate Password to generate it and then click copy to copy the password on the clipboard.
You can select the how many characters the password will be conformed of.

import random

from tkinter import *

import pyperclip
